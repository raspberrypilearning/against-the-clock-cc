## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make a timer, which can be used to challenge their friends!

## Resources

For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:55342-38825-28229-57221](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:55342-38825-28229-57221), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Against-the-Clock.hex
+ microbit-Countdown.hex

## Learning Objectives
+ Repetition (`while` loop);
+ `not` Boolean operator.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Challenge your friends!" - use the timer to set challenges for others to complete.
+ "Counting Down" - using a `while` loop to create a timer that counts down until it reaches 0.
